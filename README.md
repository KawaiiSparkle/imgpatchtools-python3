## Issue and Pull requests
Actually,I am not able to write codes.
So Sorry I can't solve your problems in many times.
If you PR,I'll merge it.

## How I wrote this
I goto the [deepwiki page of imgpatchtools repository](https://deepwiki.com/erfanoabdi/imgpatchtools) and ask the ai to write a python3 implemention of the ApplyPatch and BlockImageUpdate.
With 2 days and 2 windows I opened to asked it about 100 times to make it completely and realstic as it can(but I still haven't fixed the move command wrong and many potential bugs)
I also have tried the other model like Kimi,Doubao(AI Code Mode) and Tencent-Hunyuan.
But they haven't write so completely like this version I post.
